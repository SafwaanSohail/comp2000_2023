Clone this repository (well done!)

# Task 1

Take a look at the two repositories:

  * (A) https://bitbucket.org/altmattr/personalised-correlation/src/master/
  * (B) https://github.com/Whiley/WhileyCompiler

And answer the following questions about them:

  * These repositories are at two different websites - github and bitbucket - what are these sites?  What service do they provide? Which is better?

  The main difference between Bitbucket and GitHub is that Bitbucket is focused on private repositories and allows to have 5 collaborators for free, while GitHub is a better fit for public repositories. On private repositories, GitHub only allows 3 collaborators for free. Github is really good for public or open source repos whereas Bitbucket is good for private repos so it really depends on the use case of the repo.

  * Who made the last commit to repository A?

  Matthew Roberts


  * Who made the first commit to repository A?

  Matthew Roberts

  * Who made the first and last commits to repository B?

  Dave Pearce

  * Are either/both of these projects active at the moment? ðŸ¤” If not, what do you think happened?

  Both repos are dead, repos A looks like is complete, For repo B it looks like Dave gave up.

  * ðŸ¤” Which file in each project has had the most activity?

# Task 2

The repository you just cloned is a VSCode project, so lets work with it.  It currently will print "Hello World" message to the console when run.

You will find "Run" and "Debug" commands over the `main` method.  Try them out.  You can also trigger them with `F5` for "Debug" and `Ctrl-F5` for "Run"

Modify the application so that instead it prints
